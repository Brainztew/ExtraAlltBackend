    "AI: Ah, dear traveler! In the grand tales of Middle-earth, Gimli, son of Gl√≥in, stands stalwart and wise. By the time of the great Fellowship's formation, he hath seen 139 years pass, a sprightly age for a Dwarf! Aye, stout of heart and mighty in battle, he marches alongside Elves and Men. Wouldst thou inquire more of this noble son of Durin?",
    "AI: Ah, a query most intriguing, akin to the lore of Middle-earth itself! Legolas, son of Thranduil, is an Elf of the Woodland Realm, and his years are many, though oft unspoken in precise number. In the tales of the Third Age, he may be youthfully accounted, yet his age could span several centuries, even nearing a millennium. Alas, Elven-kind do not mark their years as Men do, for they are ageless and timeless, as the stars in the night sky!",
    "AI: Ah, Legolas of the Woodland Realm! A fine Elf of the Eldar, he is. Though the exact number of years he has wandered upon Middle-earth is not written in the Red Book, it is whispered amongst the wise that he is over 500, perhaps nearer to 2,000 springs. A mere glimmer in the eternal light of the Elves! Truly a child among his kin, yet a sage to the race of Men. Mayhap even Gandalf himself would chuckle and say, \"Age is but a tale told by the stars.\"",
    "AI: Ah, young traveler, in the realm of Middle-earth, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, is no mere mortal of short years. As of the great War of the Ring, he has seen 87 winters. Long has he wandered the wilds as a Ranger, guided by wisdom and the whispers of destiny!",
    "AI: Ah, curious traveler, you seek the age of the Ents, those ancient shepherds of the forest. In the time before the sun and moon, when the world was young and the trees were but saplings, the Entwives tended the groves and Ents walked the woods. Their years are uncounted, stretching back to the Elder Days. Remember, young hobbits might count their birthdays, but for Ents, the stories are more aged than the Shire itself! So, in short, they are as old as Middle-earth remembers. Keep your feet on the path and your heart filled with song!",
    "AI: Ah, gentle traveler of Middle-earth, I see thou art inquiring about the great tomes of adventure penned by the venerable J.R.R. Tolkien! There are three volumes in \"The Lord of the Rings\" saga: *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*. But do not overlook *The Hobbit*, where the journey first begins! Four tales of epic quests await thee, each one a precious gem, much like the One Ring itself.",
    "AI: Ah, my dear traveler of Middle-earth! Thou seekest knowledge of the grand tales woven in the fires of cinema? Verily, there are six epic films that unfurl the legend of Tolkien's world.

    "AI: Ah, dear traveler, in the realm of Middle-earth, 'tis known that orcs are creatures molded by malice and shadow. Their hearts hold little kindness, for they were twisted by dark sorcery in ages past. Yet, amidst the shadow, the sun may shine on the unlikeliest of spirits, revealing flickers of change. But beware! To find such a heart among orcs is as rare as mithril in the mountains. Proceed with caution and keep your wits about you!",
    "AI: Ah, noble seeker of Elven lore! In Middle-earth, the Elves are a sundry folk, their full count known only to the wise. Yet, within the realms of Rivendell, Lothl√≥rien, and the Grey Havens, their fair numbers dwindle as the Ages pass. Alas, they are not as populous as Men or Dwarves. Seek not a number, but the beauty of each immortal soul, for that is where their true magic lies! Now, let us away to other matters of Middle-earth!",
    "AI: Ah, noble seeker of tales, at Helm's Deep there gathered a fearsome host of ten thousand orcs, driven by the malice of Saruman. A multitude of darkness they were, eager to lay waste to the fortress of Rohan. But despair not, for valor and courage shone brighter than the darkest night! üçÉ‚ú®",

    "AI: Ah, traveler of distant lands! In the grand tome known as \"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" penned by the valiant scribe J.R.R. Tolkien, you shall find that the number of pages may vary with the printing and edition.

    "AI: Ah, in the fair realm of Middle-earth, love's light shines in many forms, as varied as the stars above Rivendell. While the tales we hear oft speak of great quests and battles, know that hearts, much like the lands of the Shire, are rich and diverse. So, with a merry twinkle in the eye, one might say: Yes, indeed, amidst elves, dwarves, and men, love knows no bounds, and it blooms where it will, like elanor upon the slopes of Lothl√≥rien!",
    "AI: Ah, dear traveler of Middle-earth, the lands are vast and filled with tales both spoken and unspoken. In the Shire, Rivendell, and beyond, hearts find companionship in many forms‚Äîyet love's stories often whisper rather than shout.

    "AI: Ah, young traveler, in the realm of Middle-earth, the age of Legolas, son of Thranduil, is cloaked in the mists of time. Elves are wont to measure not their years as mortals do.

Aye, he is youthful amongst the Eldar, yet venerable to the eyes of mortals!",

    "mums@mail.com: how many orcs in battle of helms deep?",
    "AI: Verily, good traveler, one must know that the Shire is not a place where elves dwell in great numbers. Rarely do they roam its rolling hills, for their hearts belong to forests deep and towers tall. Yet, from time to time, an elven foot might grace its paths, like a fleeting whisper of the ancient songs. So, the count is fleeting, as ephemeral as their presence.",
    "mums@mail.com: How many elfs in the shire?",
    "isacsson_89@hotmail.com: Yeah!",
    "AI: Ah, noble seeker of tales from the realm of Middle-earth! At the great Battle of Helm's Deep, it is said that Saruman's foul army, numbering ten thousand strong, did assail the fortress.

    "AI bot: Ah, traveler, thou asketh about the wretched orc-kind! In the shadowed lands, these foul creatures oft do not tarry to great age, for their lives are full of strife and battle.

    "love@mail.se: Hey bot which car is the most expensive they tested?",
    "AI bot: Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your steering wheels! The priciest piece of automotive art that graced the Top Gear track was none other than the mesmerizing Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. It‚Äôs faster than a cheetah on a skateboard and, quite frankly, costs as much as a small island. More speed, more power, and it leaves your bank account gasping for breath!",
    "love@mail.se: Wow that sound cool!",
    "love@mail.se: Hey bot how much did it cost?",
    "AI bot: Well, if it‚Äôs anything like a crackin‚Äô day at the track with a V12, it costs just enough to make your accountant break a sweat and your bank manager reach for the smelling salts. But remember, you can't put a price on automotive nirvana! Keep the pedal to the metal!",
    "love@mail.se: Hey bot how many seasons so far?",
    "AI bot: Blimey! As of now, \"Top Gear\" has revved through 33 high-octane seasons! That's more tire smoke and near misses than you can shake a gear stick at! Keep your seatbelts fastened for more!",
    "AI bot: {\"content\":\"Well, that‚Äôs a bit like asking which tyre is the best on a supercar, isn‚Äôt it? Some might say it's the bloke with the curly hair and loud opinions, others might point to the hamster who‚Äôs always getting into trouble, and then there‚Äôs Captain Slow, bringing up the rear. They‚Äôre all stars in their own unique, revved-up ways!\"}",
    "love@mail.se: hi!",
    "AI bot: Ah, the eternal question! If I had to pick just one, it would be the indomitable Ford GT. It's a sleek symphony of speed and style, with a roar like a lion and the spirit of a thoroughbred racing horse. It's the kind of car that makes you want to grow a moustache, don a pair of aviators, and chase sunsets all day long. Absolutely brilliant!"
